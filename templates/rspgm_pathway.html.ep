	This graph shows the result of infering interaction path of the canonical Wnt/&beta;-catenin pathway, an interaction path between <i>egl-20</i> (Wnt ligand) and <i>sys-1</i> (&beta;-catenin), based on RSPGM scored integrative PPI network in <i>C. elegans</i>. The inferred interaction path, with highest path score, includes 8 genes. 6 out of them, in orange color, have been validated to be Wnt pathway components by literature study. The other 2 genes, in grey color, are not Wnt pathway components, but are highly related with Wnt pathway. The deatails are demonstrated in our paper (Huang <i>et al.</i>, 2015).
